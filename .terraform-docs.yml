  # Elestio MySQL Cluster Terraform module

  If you can't afford for your database to be down for even a few minutes, a Multi-Master cluster is a great option to ensure high availability.

  A multi-master scenario means that one node can be taken offline (e.g. for maintenance or upgrade purposes) without impacting availability, as the other node will continue to serve production traffic. Further, it doubles your capacity to read or write to the database and provides an additional layer of protection against data loss.

  {{ .Header }}

  This module deploy 2 MySQL nodes on Elestio and commands are automatically executed to link them using the multi-master feature.

  ## Usage

  There is a ready-to-deploy example included in the [examples](https://github.com/elestio-examples/terraform-elestio-mysql-cluster/tree/main/examples) folder but simple usage is as follows:

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/doc/main.tf" }}
  ```

  ## Examples

  - [Get Started](https://github.com/elestio-examples/terraform-elestio-mysql-cluster/tree/main/examples/get_started) - Ready-to-deploy example which creates MySQL Cluster on Elestio with Terraform in 5 minutes.

  ## How to use Multi-Master cluster

  If you can configure your two master clusters in Round Robin in your MySQL driver, a load balancer is not needed. The client-side will split the traffic between your instances and avoid a dead node. This helps to greatly simplify the high-availability system.
